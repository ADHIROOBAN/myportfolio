            <div class="project">
                <h2>INDOOR NAVIGATION USING UWB</h2>
                <p>The project aims to provide precise location tracking and navigation services for users within a building using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology. A multidisciplinary team of researchers and engineers with expertise in fields such as computer science, electrical engineering, and geomatics will conduct extensive research on UWB technology, indoor navigation, and building management systems to design and develop the navigation system. The system is expected to provide reliable and precise navigation to users within the building, which can be useful for a wide range of applications such as wayfinding for visitors, asset tracking for facilities management, and emergency response. Additionally, the integration with other building systems will provide a more seamless and efficient building management experience.</p>
